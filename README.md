### Group-Craiglist
I've tried to combine all of our pages. They are not linked together at this point so you'll have to enter each URL in manually.

*What I made:
**My page asignment was the grid view page. We then pulled elements from mine and included them on all pages.
**The header accross all pages
**The searchbar accross all pages
**The breadcrum Navigation accross all pages,
**The view section, page selection, and sort selection accross all pages
**The foooter accross all pages
**Navigation breakpoints accross pages.

*What I'd like to do next
**link all pages to eachother 
**incorparate more javascript so that the buttons worked as intended
**Clean up styling accross the site and reracter the code
